A Clojure raytracer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikera/enlight.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikera/enlight)

### Planned features:

 - Very fast rendering (competitive with POV-Ray)
 - Clojure-based DSL for powerful scene description / generation
 - Integration with Clisk (https://github.com/mikera/clisk )library for procedural texture generation
 

### Usage

Enlight is still early in development. Feel free to explore or hack with it, but don't expect it to be fully functional yet.

You can include it as a dependency from Clojars (see: https://clojars.org/net.mikera/enlight).

See `demo.clj` for example usage: https://github.com/mikera/enlight/blob/master/src/main/clojure/enlight/samples/demo.clj


### IN DEVLOPMENT

 - Currently only the basic framework is in place
